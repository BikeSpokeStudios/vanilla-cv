# vanilla-resume

I created a resume for my software engineering and educator career.

This resume is built using

* [Vanilla CSS Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

The Vanilla framework is an alternative to Bootstrap that allows for rapid prototyping and creating good-looking websites. It employs some nice typefaces.
